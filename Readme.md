# Pico Badminton

Game design specification for Pico Badminton: a game about glory, smash shots, and hitting a shuttlecock back and forth...

<br>

## Motivation

This repo is an experiment in using Haskell for game design thinking. So while the code compiles, it doesn't actually display a game, or accept user input of any kind.

To actually play the game, one would have to write an implementation in their game framework of choice, using the Haskell source as a specification.
