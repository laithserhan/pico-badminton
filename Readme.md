# Pico Badminton

Game design specification for Pico Badminton, a game about glory, smash shots, and hitting a ball back and forth...

<br>

## Motivation

This repo is an experiment in using Haskell for game design thinking. Once the game is fully specified, one can easily write an implementation in their game framework of choice. (Mine would be PICO-8.)
